<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

- To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- You only need a browser to run the html file in.
-  A web browser: You will need a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari to view and test your project.
A code editor: You will need a code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom to write, edit, and manage your project's files.
A local server: You will need a local server such as XAMPP or WAMP to run your project locally and test it on your own computer.
Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: You will need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to build a web development project.
Familiarity with Git and GitHub: If you are using Git and GitHub to manage your project's codebase, you will need to be familiar with how to use them.

### Setup

- Create a new folder to store the files in.
- Open a command-line interface (e.g. Terminal on Mac or Linux, Command Prompt on Windows).
Navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository using the cd command.
Use the git clone command followed by the repository's URL to clone the repository. For example: git clone https://github.com/techmoves/Awesome-books.git
Press enter and wait for the repository to finish cloning.

### Install

Install this project with:

- Open your command prompt or terminal and run.

- git clone  [https://github.com/techmoves/Awesome-books.git]

- Clone the repository to your local machine using the git clone command as described in the previous answer.
Navigate to the project folder using a command-line interface such as Terminal or Command Prompt.
Install any necessary dependencies using a package manager such as NPM or Yarn. You can do this by running the npm install or yarn install command in the project folder.
Start the local server using a command such as npm start or yarn start, depending on the project's setup.
Open a web browser and navigate to the local server's URL to view and test the project.
-

### Usage

- Assuming that you have installed the project's dependencies and started the local server, you can run the project by following these steps:

Open a web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.
In the address bar, type the URL of the local server that you started in the previous step. This will typically be something like http://localhost:3000.
Press enter to navigate to the local server's URL.
The project should now be running in your web browser. Use the website's interface to interact with the project and test its functionality.
